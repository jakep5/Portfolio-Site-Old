                        I am an ex-premed student who has since decided to change career choices and follow their passion of computers and software
                        development. I've always been enthralled by the interworkings of computers, having built a computer of my own
                        and developed a strong intrigue for how computers function. I enjoy coding because it gives me an ever-lasting 
                        creative outlet and motivates me to continually develop problem solving skills, which I have found to be extremely 
                        helpful in all areas of life!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While not positioned infront of my computer, I can be found attempting to not die while running, playing with my dog, 
                        playing guitar, or spending time outdoors. I love people and enjoy socializing with people I have never met before. I am
                        somewhat of an overthinker, so I have developed a habit of meditation and zoning out to music.
